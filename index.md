### R Projects

[Implementing Gradient Descent Algorithm in Estimating Regression Coefficients](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_23/)
<br><br>
This project manually implements the gradient descent algorithm and evaluates a range of values for the learning rate and epoch count parameters to optimally estimate the coefficients of a linear regression model. The cost function optimization profiles of the different candidate parameter settings were compared, with the resulting estimated coefficients assessed against those obtained using normal equations which served as the reference baseline values.

[Formulating Segmented Groups Using Clustering Algorithms](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_22/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various clustering algorithms for segmenting information. Methods applied in the analysis to cluster high dimensional data included the K-Means, Partitioning Around Medoids, Fuzzy Analysis Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Agglomerative Nesting and Divisive Analysis Clustering algorithms. The different clustering algorithms were subjectively evaluated based on their capability to effectively capture the latent characteristics between the different resulting clusters. In addition, the values for the average silhouette width obtained for each algorithm were also assessed for an objective comparison of their clustering performance.

[Extracting Information Using Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_21/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various dimensionality reduction algorithms for extracting information. Methods applied in the analysis to transform and reduce high dimensional data included the Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition, Independent Component Analysis, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection algorithms. The different dimensionality reduction algorithms were subjectively evaluated based on their capability to effectively capture the latent characteristics between the different resulting components.

[Remedial Procedures for Skewed Data with Extreme Outliers](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_20/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various remedial procedures for handling skewed data with extreme outliers for classification. Using a Logistic Regression model structure, methods applied in the analysis to address data distribution skewness and outlying points included the Box-Cox Transformation, Yeo-Johnson Transformation, Exponential Transformation, Inverse Hyperbolic Sine Transformation, Base-10 Logarithm Transformation, Natural Logarithm Transformation, Square Root Transformation, Outlier Winsorization Treatment and Outlier Spatial Sign Treatment. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models applying various remedial procedures were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric. The ROC AUC values were compared to that of the baseline model which made use of data without any form of data trasnformation and treatment.

[Selecting Informative Predictors Using Univariate Filters](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_18/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various univariate filters in selecting informative predictors for a modelling problem. Using the Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest and Naive Bayes model structures, feature selection methods applied in the analysis included the P-Value Threshold Computed with Bonferroni Correction and Correlation Cutoff. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models applying various univariate filters were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric. The ROC AUC values were compared to those of the baseline models which made use of the full data without any form of feature selection.

[Selecting Informative Predictors Using Recursive Feature Elimination](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_17/)
<br><br>
This project implements recursive feature elimination in selecting informative predictors for a modelling problem using the Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors model structures. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models applying recursive feature elimination were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric. The ROC AUC values were compared to those of the baseline models which made use of the full data without any form of feature selection, or implemented a model-specific feature selection process.

[Treatment Comparison Tests Between a Single Two-Level Factor Variable and a Single Numeric Response Variable](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_3/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various methods in comparatively evaluating the numeric response data between two treatment groups in a clinical trial. Statistical tests applied in the analysis included the Student’s T-Test, Welch T-Test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test and Robust Rank-Order Test.

[Data Quality Assessment, Preprocessing and Exploration for a Regression Modelling Problem](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_2/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various methods in assessing data quality, implementing data preprocessing and conducting exploratory analysis for prediction problems with numeric responses. Remedial procedures addressing data quality issues including missing data, extreme outlying points, near-zero variance, multicollinearity and skewed distributions were evaluated.

[Data Quality Assessment, Preprocessing and Exploration for a Classification Modelling Problem](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_1/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various methods in assessing data quality, implementing data preprocessing and conducting exploratory analysis for prediction problems with categorical responses. Remedial procedures addressing data quality issues including missing data, extreme outlying points, near-zero variance, multicollinearity and skewed distributions were evaluated.

### Scientific Research Papers

[High Diagnostic Accuracy of Epigenetic Imprinting Biomarkers in Thyroid Nodules](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.22.00232)
<br><br>
This paper published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology is a collaborative study on formulating a thyroid cancer predicton model using epigenetic imprinting biomarkers. Statistical methods were applied accordingly during differential analysis; gene screening study; and diagnostic grading model building, optimization and validation. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric was used to measure the discrimination power of the candidate predictors, with the classification performance of the candidate models evaluated using the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) metrics. The final prediction model was internally validated using a 500-cycle optimism-adjusted bootstrap and externally validated using an independent cohort.

<br><br>
This paper published in the Clinical Epigenetics journal is a collaborative study on malignancy differentiation for bladder, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, skin, breast, esophagus, lung, prostate and thyoid tumors using epigenetic imprinting biomarkers. Statistical methods were applied accordingly during differential analysis; gene screening study; and diagnostic classification model building. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric was used to measure the discrimination power of the candidate predictors, with the classification performance of the candidate models evaluated using the sensitivity and specificity metrics. The preliminary models presented were exploratory in nature and were not externally validated using an independent cohort.
