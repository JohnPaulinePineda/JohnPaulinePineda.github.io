### R Projects

[Treatment Comparison Tests Between a Single Two-Level Factor Variable and a Single Numeric Response Variable](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_3/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various methods in comparatively evaluating the numeric response data between two treatment groups in a clinical trial. Statistical tests applied in the analysis included the Student’s T-Test, Welch T-Test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test and Robust Rank-Order Test.

[Data Quality Assessment, Preprocessing and Exploration for a Regression Modelling Problem](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_2/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various methods in assessing data quality, implementing data preprocessing and conducting exploratory analysis for prediction problems with numeric responses. Remedial procedures addressing data quality issues including missing data, extreme outlying points, near-zero variance, multicollinearity and skewed distributions were evaluated.

[Data Quality Assessment, Preprocessing and Exploration for a Classification Modelling Problem](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_1/)
<br><br>
This project explores the various methods in assessing data quality, implementing data preprocessing and conducting exploratory analysis for prediction problems with categorical responses. Remedial procedures addressing data quality issues including missing data, extreme outlying points, near-zero variance, multicollinearity and skewed distributions were evaluated.

### Scientific Papers

[High Diagnostic Accuracy of Epigenetic Imprinting Biomarkers in Thyroid Nodules](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.22.00232)
<br><br>
This paper published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology is a collaborative study on formulating a thyroid cancer predicton model using epigenetic imprinting biomarkers. Statistical methods were applied accordingly during differential analysis; gene screening study; and diagnostic grading model building, optimization and validation. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric was used to measure the discrimination power of the candidate predictors, with the classification performance of the candidate models evaluated using the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) metrics. The final prediction model was internally validated using a 500-cycle optimism-adjusted bootstrap and externally validated using an independent cohort.

[Epigenetic Imprinting Alterations as Effective Diagnostic Biomarkers for Early-Stage Lung Cancer and Small Pulmonary Nodules](https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-021-01203-5)
<br><br>
This paper published in Clinical Epigenetics is a collaborative study on formulating a lung cancer predicton model using epigenetic imprinting biomarkers. Statistical methods were applied accordingly during differential analysis; gene screening study; and diagnostic grading model building, optimization and validation. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric was used to measure the discrimination power of the candidate predictors, with the classification performance of the candidate models evaluated using the sensitivity and specificity metrics. The final prediction model was externally validated using an independent cohort.

[Novel Visualized Quantitative Epigenetic Imprinted Gene Biomarkers Diagnose the Malignancy of Ten Cancer Types](https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-020-00861-1)
<br><br>
This paper published in Clinical Epigenetics is a collaborative study on malignancy differentiation for bladder, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, skin, breast, esophagus, lung, prostate and thyoid tumors using epigenetic imprinting biomarkers. Statistical methods were applied accordingly during differential analysis; gene screening study; and diagnostic classification model building. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric was used to measure the discrimination power of the candidate predictors, with the classification performance of the candidate models evaluated using the sensitivity and specificity metrics. The preliminary models presented were exploratory in nature and were not externally validated using an independent cohort.
